    Normalization is a process to eliminate the flaws of a database with bad design. A poorly designed database is inconsistent and create issues while adding, deleting or updating information.

    The following makes Database Normalization a crucial step in database design process âˆ’

    Resolving the database anomalies
    The forms of Normalization i.e. 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCF, 4NF and 5NF remove all the Insert, Update and Delete anomalies.

    Insertion Anomaly occurs when you try to insert data in a record that does not exist.

    Deletion Anomaly is when a data is to be deleted and due to the poor deign of database, other record also deletes.

    Eliminate Redundancy of Data
    Storing same data item multiple times is known as Data Redundancy. A normalized table do not have the issue of redundancy of data.

    Data Dependency
    The data gets stored in the correct table and ensures normalization.

    Isolation of Data
    A good designed database states that the changes in one table or field do not affect other. This is achieved through Normalization.

    Data Consistency
    While updating if a record is left, it can led to inconsistent data, Normalization resolves it and ensures Data Consistency.
